README 

Hello I making this git with all my little snippets Ive made over the last year. I will document them as best as I can. But if you guys have any questions feel free to contact me whenever you need :D Ill be happy to help.

Snippets:

1. DataLayer for GTM Folder: Includes DataLayerForGTM.html: This is a snippet to push the information of the DataLayer of all your visitors to you Google Tag Manater or GTM. I made this code to fit most of the themes with little to no effor in installing this code into your theme.  DataLayerForGTMCheckout.html: Ive added the code for the Checkout.liquid (if you are a Plus Merchant, I don't know a way to inlcude the code of the DataLayer on the Checkout proccess otherwise.). DataLayerForGTMThankyou.html: which goes in the Aditional Scripts under Settings>Checkout>Aditional Scripts

PREREQUIREMENTS: You'll need to have the Google Tag Manager code set up in your theme.

Like I said Ill be happy to help anyone who needs it :D 

Keed Coding people!

Cheers

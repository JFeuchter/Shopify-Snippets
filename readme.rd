README 

Hello I making this git with all my little snippets Ive made over the last year. I will document them as best as I can. But if you guys have any questions feel free to contact me whenever you need :D Ill be happy to help.

Snippets:

1. DataLayerForGTM.html: This is a snippet to push the information of the DataLayer of all your visitors to you Google Tag Manater or GTM. I made this code to fit most of the themes with little to no effor in installing this code into your theme. 

PREREQUIREMENTS: You'll need to have the Google Tag Manager code set up in your theme. Ill add the code later on. 

Like I said Ill be happy to help anyone who needs it :D 

Keed Coding people!

Cheers
